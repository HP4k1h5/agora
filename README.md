## installation

### requirements
- [nodeJs](https://nodeJs.org) v10.0+

1) download or clone this repo  
`git clone https://github.com/HP4k1h5/iexcli.git`

2) get dependencies  
run `yarn` in this directory  
or `npm install`

3) add a **publishable** iex api key  
- either export an ENV var named IEX_PUB_KEY  
ex. `export IEX_PUB_KEY=pk_Y0urIeXaPipUbl15h4bLeKEY`
- or set the `IEX_PUB_KEY` in `config.json` in this repo

**register for a free [iex
account](https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register)**
copy the **publishable** api key. These typically start with `pk`

## usage
RUN `node src/index.js` from the root of this directory, or `yarn run run`

Most interaction is through the repl emulator in the bottom right corner of the
screen. It accepts commands and updates the charts and data windows. If a
component has more data than fits on the screen, try scrolling it with the
mouse. Some components also accept, `up` and `down` keys to scroll through
items, such as the watchlist.

Use `tab` or `esc` to return to repl. Hit `enter` to update the components.

Type `help` or `h` for general information. Type e.g. `h $` or `h :` for
command-specific help.

### commands

#### `help` or `h`
Typing `help` or `h` brings up a help menu. If you include another command
name after, command-specific help is returned.  
**examples**
```bash
help $   # show help for stock prefix command
h :      # show help for time prefix command
h        # show general help
```

#### `quit` or `exit`
Typing `quit` or `exit` will exit the app

#### `$` stock ticker symbol prefix
Typing `$` followed immediately by a stock ticker symbol changes the currently
active symbol, updating all visible charts and data windows. Can be combined
with time prefix to update multiple values at the same time  
**examples**
```bash
$tsla          # update active symbol to TSLA
$BRK.B :1.5h   # update active symbol to BRK.B and update time to last 90 minutes
```

#### `:` time range prefix
Typing `:` followed immediately by a combination of the following paramters
will change the currently active time range and update all visible charts and
data windows.  
**valid times ranges** `5d, 1m, 3m, 6m, ytd, 1y, 5y, max`  OR  
numeric values affixed with `min` or `h`, see examples.  
Can be combined with time prefix to update multiple values at the same time  
**examples**
```bash
:100min        # update time to last 100 minutes
:6.5h          # update time to last trading day
:5d  $x        # update time to last 5 days and update stock to X
```

#### `!` news command
Typing `!` brings up the news display with the latest 20 results relevant to
the active symbol. Use arrow keys `up` and `down` to navigate the table. Use
`tab` or `esc` to return to repl. Can be combined with stock prefix to update
multiple values at the same time  
![news display for iexcli](img/news.png)

$de !          # show news and update active stock to DE
! $ibm         # show news and update stock to ibm
```

#### `=` watchlist command
Typing `=` brings up the watchlist display. Use arrow keys `up` and `down` to
navigate the table. Use `tab` or `esc` to return to repl.  
![watchlist display for iexcli](img/watchlist.png) Key values `open high low
