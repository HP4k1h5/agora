## installation

### requirements
- [nodeJs](https://nodeJs.org) v10.0+

1) download or clone this repo
    1) either `git clone https://github.com/HP4k1h5/iexcli.git` and get
      dependencies by running `yarn` in this directory
    2) or run `yarn global add @hp4k1h5/iexcli`  OR  `npm i -g @hp4k1h5/iexcli`

2) add a **publishable** iex api key
    1) either export an ENV var named IEX_PUB_KEY  
    ex. `export IEX_PUB_KEY=pk_Y0urIeXaPipUbl15h4bLeKEY`
    2) or set the `IEX_PUB_KEY` in `config.json` in this repo. If you
    installed globally through yarn or npm =, you will have to find the
    package at its global install location. By default on a mac, this may be
    `~/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/@hp4k1h5/iexcli`

**register for a free [iex
account](https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register)** and copy the **publishable** api key. These typically start with `pk`

## usage

If you installed globally, you should be able to use the bash alias `iexcli`
from anywhere. Be sure to refresh your terminal or start a new terminal window
after installing so that the alias can be found. If you still cannot find an
alias, try running `yarn link` form this project directory root. Otherwise, if
you downloaded with git or to a local directory, RUN
`node src/index.js` from the root of this directory, or `yarn run run`.

Most interaction is through the repl emulator in the bottom right corner of the
screen. It accepts commands and updates the charts and data windows. If a
component has more data than fits on the screen, try scrolling it with the
mouse. Some components also accept, `up` and `down` keys to scroll through
items, such as the watchlist.

Use `tab` or `esc` to return to repl. Hit `enter` to update the components.

Type `help` or `h` for general information. Type e.g. `h $` or `h :` for
command-specific help.

### commands

#### `help` or `h`
Typing `help` or `h` brings up a help menu. If you include another command
name after, command-specific help is returned.  
**examples**
```bash
help $   # show help for stock prefix command
h :      # show help for time prefix command
h        # show general help
```

#### `quit` or `exit`
Typing `quit` or `exit` will exit the app

#### `?` search
Typing `?` followed by search terms will query stock symbols and company names
for approximate (fuzzy) matches. Capitalization and spacing is ignored as are
quotes and most other non word symbols.
If you are searching by key word like "solar", consider adding more words to
narrow down the result set  
exampless  
```bash
? electric
   tlsa    ?  
?   "american Motor" company
```

#### `$` stock ticker symbol prefix
Typing `$` followed immediately by a stock ticker symbol changes the currently
active symbol, updating all visible charts and data windows. Can be combined
with time prefix to update multiple values at the same time  
**examples**
```bash
$tsla          # update active symbol to TSLA
$BRK.B :1.5h   # update active symbol to BRK.B and update time to last 90 minutes
```

#### `:` time range prefix
Typing `:` followed immediately by a combination of the following paramters
will change the currently active time range and update all visible charts and
data windows.  
**valid times ranges** `5d, 1m, 3m, 6m, ytd, 1y, 5y, max`  OR  
numeric values affixed with `min` or `h`, see examples.  
Can be combined with time prefix to update multiple values at the same time  
**examples**
```bash
:100min        # update time to last 100 minutes
:6.5h          # update time to last trading day
:5d  $x        # update time to last 5 days and update stock to X
```

#### `!` news command
Typing `!` brings up the news display with the latest 20 results relevant to
the active symbol. Use arrow keys `up` and `down` to navigate the table. Use
`tab` or `esc` to return to repl. Can be combined with stock prefix to update
multiple values at the same time  
![news display for iexcli](img/news.png)  
**examples**
```bash
$de !          # show news and update active stock to DE
! $ibm         # show news and update stock to ibm
```

#### `=` watchlist command
Typing `=` brings up the watchlist display. Use arrow keys `up` and `down` to
navigate the table. Use `tab` or `esc` to return to repl.  
![watchlist display for iexcli](img/watchlist.png) Key values `open high low
close` are only available to iex premium data subscribers and during
non-market hours to other api consumers.  
**examples**
```bash
=
```

#### `#` chart command
Typing `#` brings up the price/volume chart display.
**examples**
```bash
# :1d $t
```

#### `&` profile command
Typing `&` brings up a profile of the active symbol. Use mouse to scroll
components.
![profile display](img/profile.png)  
**examples**
```bash
$qcom &
```
